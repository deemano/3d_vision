## 3D Vision | C++ 👨🏻‍💻 

# Project Title: Portfolio Week 6, Exercise 1(a,b,c,d,e) & 2 (a,b)

## -------------------------------------

## Requirements: Windows >=10, Visual Studio, C++17

### Installation:
1. double-click to run runMe_toSetup_OpenCV.bat file. This will automatically download all the dependencies and extract them in the right folders;
   This step will automatically set up the OpenCV and Eigen3 libraries. 
   Follow the console steps: approve the Admin requests for extraction, close extraction etc. (all automated)

2. open Visual Studio > File > Open Folder > navigate to the project main folder and click Select Folder button; 		
   This will automatically generate the entire project based on CMakeLists.txt, link dependencies and set up ALL paths;

3. In Visual Studio go to Build > Build All. This will build the whole project.
   After this last point, you can run the C++ main.cpp script and make any modifications neccesary. 
   
   The entire project structure should be accesable via VS Solution Explorer.

4. All .cpp files should be in the /src folder and all hpp files should be in /include folder. All are already connected to main.cpp.

Enjoy!!!

PS. I will also leave a shortcut in main dir to a pre-generated .exe program, in case there are unexpected issues beyond my control/work.
